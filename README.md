# Example project

This is an example of a basic project structure, containing a `setup.py` (for `pip` installation), a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) configuration, a `.gitignore` with ignore patterns generated by [gitignore.io](https://gitignore.io), and some utility functions for utilising the project structure.

The slides from my S4S talk can be found here: [doc/s4s-code.pdf](doc/s4s-code.pdf)

## Setup

In the project directory, run:
```bash
  pip install --editable .
```
and you're all good to go! The code in the `analysisproject` directory can be imported in the following way:

```python
  from analysisproject.util import find_file
```
